    <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
    <h6>For the Roux:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Heaping cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup oil (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>For the Gumbo:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Bunch celery, diced, leaves and all</li>
        <li>1 Green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 Large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 Bunch green onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 Bunch fresh chopped parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 Cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1-2 Tablespoons cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>6-8 Cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>12 ounce package andouille sausages, sliced into 'coins' (substitute Polska Kielbasa if you can't find a good Andouille)</li>
        <li>Meat from 1 Rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>2 Cups shrimps, pre-cooked</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Directions:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Make the Roux:</em> In a large, heavy bottom pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 30-45 minutes. This part takes patience-- when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, "cookie dough" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.</li>
        <li><em>Brown the sausage.</em> In a separate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate.</li>
        <li><em>Cook the vegetables in broth.</em> Add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley and roux to the pot and stir well.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste.</li>
        <li><em>Add meat.</em> Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp.</li>
        <li><em>Taste and serve.</em> At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking-- salt, pepper, chicken buillion paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth-- until reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day!)</li>
    </ol>
